Road map:
- Get Board and main up-and-running enough to play a game against a friend/self
- Develop logic to prevent illegal actions
- Develop logic to know when the game is over
- (Optional): develop logic to determine when the outcome is known, even before last move played.
- Update structure to enable computer to play
- Implement Com that just plays random moves for now
- Update main to allow player to choose to play against computer
- (Big one) develop Com logic to be UNBEATABLE
- Beautify and polish
