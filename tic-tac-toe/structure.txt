Outline:
    tic_tac_toe
        -class Player
            -just a datatype for X or O
        -class Board
            -stores board state as 2d list
            -contains play method for modifying board state
            -contains methods for reading board state
        -class Com
            -Takes in Board object and Player object for working with
            -contains functions for playing AI moves on board for single-Player
    main
        -constant X (Player object)
        -constant O (Player object)
        -pick gamemode
        -initialize game
        -game loop


Road map:
- Get Board and main up-and-running enough to play a game against a friend/self
- Develop logic to prevent illegal actions
- Develop logic to know when the game is over
- (Optional): develop logic to determine when the outcome is known, even before last move played.
- Implement Com that just plays random moves for now
- Update main to allow player to choose to play against computer
- (Big one) develop Com logic to be UNBEATABLE
- Beautify and polish
